        <h2>About Monster Energy</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Monster Energy is committed to providing energy to fuel life's adventures, from extreme sports to everyday challenges.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Monster Energy is an energy drink that was created by Hansen Natural Company (now Monster Beverage Corporation) in April 2002. As of 2022, Monster Energy had a 30.1% share of the American energy drink market, the second-highest after Red Bull.</p>   
        <p>The design was created by McLean Design, a California-based strategic branding firm. The logo is composed of a vibrant green "M", composed of three lines on a field of black. The "M" is stylized in such a way as to imply that it is formed by the claws of a monster ripping through the can.</p>
